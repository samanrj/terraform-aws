
Solution Overview:

  Base components:
    - a VPC, private and public subnets, security groups etc.

  An Application Load Balancer:
    - Which sits in front on the public subnets of the default VPC and manages HA in its own
    - Allows traffic from 0.0.0.0 on 443/HTTPS and does tls termination using a dummy certificate
    - Attaches itself to an Auto-scaling Group with target machines on the same AZ's ==>

  An ASG:
    - Consisting of min 2, max 4, desired 2, general purpose EC2 instances (AWS Linux AMI)
    - Instances located in the back on the private subnets of the default VPC and placed in two AZ's,
    - Instances allow traffic from ELB on 80/HTTP
    - We monitor CPU utilisation as a dynamic scaling trigger point

Things I can improve:
- Found out about this https://github.com/terraform-aws-modules/terraform-aws-alb/tree/v5.10.0/examples/complete-alb a bit too late, otherwise could've just implemented it instead of a load of tinkering I did on my own. That being said, it did look a bit too advanced for my knowledge level and the tinkering was good for learning!
- Launch Configuration will be deprecated by AWS, I wish I had time to replace it with Launch Templates instead
- Terraform outputs


How to run:
cd src/
terraform plan \
  -var-file="variables.tf"
terraform apply


Known issues:
  - While code fully passes a terraform plan, actual launch of instances by the ASG fails and they are marked as Terminated in my personal AWS console, need more time to investigate this but suspect an issue with Launch Configuration
  - Security Groups... I think I've slightly confused myself with them, but suspect not complete as they stand today.
